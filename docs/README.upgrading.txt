If you are running very old versions, this version may not work directly
until you run prior versions as explained in this file.

If you are running a version older than 0.8.x, you must first install
version 0.8.x (e.g. 0.8.2) and run that once. Then heed the next paragraph.

If you are running a version older than 0.11x, you must first install
version 0.9.x or 0.10.x (e.g. 0.10.1) and run that once.

Then you can install and run this version.
